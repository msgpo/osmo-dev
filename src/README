This dir is intended to keep all the git clones.

There are some handy scripts I use for my daily Osmocom development:

 ./g   run a git command in each source tree
 ./e   run an arbitrary shell command in each source tree
 ./st  show a brief branch and local mods status for each source tree
 ./s   walk through each source tree and use gitk as well as user interaction
       to quickly fast-forward / reset changes coming in from upstream. (This
       is potentially dangerous, but safe if you only hit enter every time.)

Examples:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

./g fetch    # run 'git fetch' in each clone = fetch all from upstream
